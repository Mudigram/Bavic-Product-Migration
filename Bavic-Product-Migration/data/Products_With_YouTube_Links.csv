6673,simple,,,Mace Rechargeable Rotary Cutter,1,0,visible,,"1. Useful: Compared to manual scissors, cordless electric cutters are stronger and more sturdy.

Multi-usage: You can effortlessly cut cardboard, fabrics, leather, plastic mat, carpet, felt, etc. It is a good tool for crafts and handicrafts.\n\n3. High Performance: This rotary fabric cutter is equipped with an automatic edge grinding system that keeps the edges of the octagonal blade sharp at all times. To ensure that every cut you make is accurate and smooth, always keep the area around the blade guard clean.\n\n4. Safety Usage: The rechargeable multipurpose cutters are equipped with a safety lock switch that requires the trigger and lock switch to be pressed to make them work, which effectively prevents the electric cutter from accidentally starting. The hand holding the safety switch can be loosened after the cutters are started. It is safer to use and saves time and energy.\n\n5.
