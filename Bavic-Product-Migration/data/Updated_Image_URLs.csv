They can be used together or separately depending on your stitching application.\n\nConnection with your sewing machine is accomplished by a renewable adhesive attached permanently to the bottom of each foot. Just remove the seam guide feet from your machine when you’re done. They leave no adhesive residue.\n\nWashing the adhesive surface on the guide foot with dish soap renews the surface and its adhesive properties.\n\nThe shapes and edges of each guide foot makes it perfect for a multitude of sewing applications.\n\nThe included grid template measures placement from the needle position and ensures that the stitch guide is always just where we want it.\n\nSo, how’s it used? Unlike other seam guides, the Stick ‘n Stitch Guide does way more than provide a single seam allowance.\n\nIn fact its innovative design provides us with six different primary applications.\n\n1. The two sections can be used either singly or together for straight stitching\n\n2. We can place one foot on either side of the needle for fast, error free quilt strips or precision placement top stitches.\n\n3.

6673,simple,BSA-00759-C,,Mace Rechargeable Rotary Cutter,1,0,visible,Sharp and reliable cutting tool for clean fabric edges.,"1. Useful: Compared to manual scissors, cordless electric cutters are stronger and more sturdy. Electric cutters allow you to cut harder materials with less tension, thus saving your time and effort.\n\n2. Multi-usage: You can effortlessly cut cardboard, fabrics, leather, plastic mat, carpet, felt, etc. It is a good tool for crafts and handicrafts.\n\n3. High Performance: This rotary fabric cutter is equipped with an automatic edge grinding system that keeps the edges of the octagonal blade sharp at all times. To ensure that every cut you make is accurate and smooth, always keep the area around the blade guard clean.\n\n4. Safety Usage: The rechargeable multipurpose cutters are equipped with a safety lock switch that requires the trigger and lock switch to be pressed to make them work, which effectively prevents the electric cutter from accidentally starting. The hand holding the safety switch can be loosened after the cutters are started. It is safer to use and saves time and energy.\n\n5. Unique Design: The ergonomic design of the handles of this cutter allows both left-handed and right-handed users to complete their cutting work smoothly.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/2HZaPJnLXqI",,,taxable,,1,19.0,,0,0,0.9,,,,1,,80000.0,83000,Cutters and Scissors,,,"https://bavicsewingaccessories.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_0759.jpg, https://bavicsewingaccessories.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_0759-1.jpg, https://bavicsewingaccessories.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_0759-2.jpg, https://bavicsewingaccessories.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_0759-3.jpg, https://bavicsewingaccessories.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_0759-4.jpg, https://bavicsewingaccessories.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_0759-5.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,
